Description: fastgssa provides a simple to use, intuitive, and
    extensible interface to several stochastic simulation
    algorithms for generating simulated trajectories of finite
    population continuous-time model. Currently it implements
    Gillespie's exact stochastic simulation algorithm (Direct
    method) and several approximate methods (Explicit tau-leap,
    Binomial tau-leap, and Optimized tau-leap). The package also
    contains a library of template models that can be run as demo
    models and can easily be customized and extended. Currently the
    following models are included, decaying-dimerization reaction
    set, linear chain system, logistic growth model, Lotka
    predator-prey model, Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model,
    Kermack-McKendrick SIR model, and a metapopulation SIRS model.
